## 方法一

最简单粗暴的方式直接在脚本`/etc/rc.d/rc.local`(和`/etc/rc.local`是同一个文件，软链)末尾添加自己的脚本，例如，

```
[root@EMQ ~]# cat /etc/rc.local 
#!/bin/bash
# THIS FILE IS ADDED FOR COMPATIBILITY PURPOSES
#
# It is highly advisable to create own systemd services or udev rules
# to run scripts during boot instead of using this file.
#
# In contrast to previous versions due to parallel execution during boot
# this script will NOT be run after all other services.
#
# Please note that you must run 'chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.local' to ensure
# that this script will be executed during boot.

touch /var/lock/subsys/local

nohup /home/frps -c /home/frps.ini >/dev/null 2>&1 &
```

然后，增加脚本执行权限，

```
chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.local
```
